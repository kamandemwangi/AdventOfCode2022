# AdventOfCode2022
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles.
Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed programming challenges, where a new puzzle is released each day from December 1st to 25th.
The puzzles are designed to be fun and challenging, and they can be solved using any programming language.
